**1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that I should use margins to make space between 2 elements on a page and that I should padding to create whitespace within an element for cosmetic reasons. Borders came in handy when I was initially sizing and spacing things out as I could clearly see how big elements were.

**2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned to appreciate the `float` and `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` settings.

**3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Getting the link/bio side bar was a lot easer than I was expecting. The most frustration came from trying to get the social media icon font to work and get positioned and spaced the way I wanted.

**4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

As long as each element is tagged with the proper class, it's possible to use CSS to do style it in any way. I also learned that I could have styles stack multiple times, and how to figure out which order they'll be stacked in.

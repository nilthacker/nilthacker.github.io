    <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>
    <p>
      Let's start with the TL;DR:
      <ul>
        <li>Content is archived automatically</li>
        <li>Easily and safely revert to older (or newer) versions of code</li>
        <li>Log who made a change, what that change was, when it was made, and why it change was made</li>
        <li>Ability to compare changes side by side</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The long(er) version:

      Most people don't just create something that's 100% perfect on the first try. It's usually a process of gradually adding and refining content until things slowly start falling in place where they belong. Using version control allows you to keep track of every iteration of your work, each step of the way. Think of verison control as a safety net, whether you're working on code, a book, or a magazine layout. You always have the ability to go back in time to a version of your work that's free of any bugs or typos. If you're working with multiple people on a project, version control allows everybody to see what each team member contributed to the project, and, when Kreiger eventually ends up breaking everything, you can go back to the working version before trying to figure out what went wrong.

    <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h4>
    <p>

        Git helps keep track of changes by comparing, line by line, the old file with the new file. (<a href="http://media02.hongkiat.com/github-image-diff/file-comparison.jpg">source</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Git only saves a snapshot of a file (also known as a commit) when you tell it to. When telling git to commit changes, it's also a good rule of thumb to leave a short message that clearly summarizes how you've changed the file since the last commit. <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">This page</a> has useful information on how to craft commit message. Once a file is committed, git will compare the new file with the old file line by line and log the changes. By doing this, git makes it dead simple to figure out which commit caused your code to stop working. Once you know which commit caused the error, it's relatively simple to review the changes. Once you know <i>where</i> the problem or error was introduced, you can get started with the difficult part of figuring out <i>how to fix it</i>.

    <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
    <p>
        Now that we know the benefits of version control and how git helps you keep track of changes, we can use GitHub to allow us to collaborate with other people on the same project. The important part of GitHub is the "Hub." GitHub takes the offline version control and change tracking features of Git and places everything "in the cloud." This way, multiple people can "check out" individual files from a project, work on them, "push" them back to GitHub, let GitHub calculate and archive the changes, and allow other team members to "pull" the changes down to their computers. This way, collaborators can work on different bits of a project (at the same or different times), send everything back to GitHub, let GitHub save and manage changes, and then download the most up-to-date version. Just as with Git, if someone makes a change that causes problems, GitHub allows that person and other team members to review the changes that were made and restore a previous working version of that file. In addition, GitHub also allows teams to perform code reviews. Suppose Team member A has worked on a file and wants GitHub to integrate that change into the master version of the code. GitHub includes a code review feature which can allow Team Member B to review Team Member A's changes and potentially intercept any program-breaking code before it's ever integrated into the stable code.

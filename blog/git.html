  <h2>A brief introduction</h2>

    <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>
    <p>
      Let's start with the TL;DR:
      <ul>
        <li>Content is archived automatically</li>
        <li>Easily and safely revert to older (or newer) versions of code</li>
        <li>Log who made a change, what that change way, when it was made, and why the change was made</li>
        <li>Ability to compare changes side by side</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that that's out of the way, let's get more in-depth.
    </p>

      Most people don't just create something that's 100% perfect on the first try. It's usually a process of gradually adding and refining content until things slowly start falling in place where they belong. Using version control allows you to keep track of every iteration of your work, each step of the way. Think of verison control as a safety net, whether you're working on code, a book, or a magazine layout. You always have the ability to go back in time to a version of your work that's free of any bugs or typos. If you're working with multiple people on a project, version control allows everybody to see what each team member contributed to the project, and, when Kreiger eventually ends up breaking everything, you can see go back to the working version before trying to figure out what went wrong.
